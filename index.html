                        <p>
                            Once upon a time, there were a little old woman and a little old man who lived in a little
                            cottage near the river. The little old woman and the little old man were hungry, so the
                            little old woman decided to bake a gingerbread man. She made a big batch of gingerbread
                            dough, then rolled it flat and cut it in the shape of a gingerbread man. She gave him
                            raisins for eyes, a cinnamon drop for a mouth, and chocolate chips for buttons. Then she put
                            the gingerbread man in the oven to bake. When the gingerbread man was done, the little old
                            woman opened the oven door, but before she could take him out, the gingerbread man jumped up
                            and ran through the kitchen and out of the cottage shouting, “Don’t eat me!” The little old
                            woman ran after the gingerbread man. “Stop,” she yelled. But the gingerbread man ran even
                            faster, chanting, “Run, run as fast as you can. You can’t catch me, I’m the gingerbread
                            man.”

                    The gingerbread man ran into the garden and passed the little old man. “Stop,” the little old man
                    called out, “I want to eat you.” But the gingerbread man ran even faster, chanting, “I’ve run away
                    from a little old woman, and I can run away from you, I can. Run, run as fast as you can. You can’t
                    catch me, I’m the gingerbread man.” The little old man chased the gingerbread man, followed by the
                    little old woman. But the gingerbread man ran too fast for them. The gingerbread man ran through the
                    yard and passed a pig. “Stop,” the pig snorted, “I want to eat you.” But the gingerbread man ran
                    even faster, chanting, “I’ve run from a little old woman and a little old man, and I can run away
                    from you, I can. Run, run as fast as you can. You can’t catch me, I’m the gingerbread man.” The pig
                    chased the gingerbread man, followed by the little old woman and the little old man. But the
                    gingerbread man ran too fast for them.

                <p>
                    Then the gingerbread man reached a wide river, but he didn’t know how to swim. A sly and hungry fox
                    saw the gingerbread man and said, “Jump on my tail, and I’ll take you across the river!” The
                    gingerbread man thought to himself, “I’ll be safe on his tail.” So he jumped on the fox’s tail and
                    they started across the river. Halfway across the river, the fox barked, “You’re too heavy for my
                    tail, jump on my back.” So the gingerbread man jumped on the fox’s back. Soon, the fox said, "You're
                    too heavy for my back, jump onto my nose.” So the gingerbread man jumped on the fox’s nose. But as
                    soon as they reached the riverbank, the fox flipped the gingerbread man into the air, snapped his
                    mouth shut
